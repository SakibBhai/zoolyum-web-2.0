# Navigation ERR_ABORTED Fix Documentation

## Issue Analysis

The application was experiencing `net::ERR_ABORTED` errors when navigating to `/about`, `/portfolio`, and `/team` routes. These errors were caused by middleware configuration conflicts with Next.js 15's React Server Components (RSC) system.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Middleware RSC Handling
- **Problem**: The middleware was incorrectly filtering RSC requests using string matching on pathname and search parameters
- **Impact**: Next.js 15 RSC requests were being blocked, causing navigation failures

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP) Restrictions
- **Problem**: Overly restrictive CSP headers were blocking legitimate Next.js navigation
- **Impact**: Frame and WebSocket connections required for Next.js 15 were being denied

### 3. Middleware Matcher Configuration
- **Problem**: The matcher pattern was too broad and conflicting with Next.js internal routing
- **Impact**: Internal Next.js requests were being processed unnecessarily

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated RSC Request Detection

**Before:**
```typescript
request.nextUrl.pathname.includes('_rsc=') ||
request.nextUrl.search.includes('_rsc=') ||
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Skip for React Server Component requests
request.headers.get('RSC') === '1' ||
request.nextUrl.searchParams.has('_rsc')
```

**Rationale**: Proper detection of RSC requests using headers and URL search parameters API instead of string matching.

### 2. Updated Content Security Policy

**Before:**
```typescript
"connect-src 'self' https://vitals.vercel-insights.com https://vercel.live",
"frame-src 'none'",
"frame-ancestors 'none'"
```

**After:**
```typescript
"connect-src 'self' https://vitals.vercel-insights.com https://vercel.live ws: wss:",
"frame-src 'self'",
"frame-ancestors 'self'"
```

**Rationale**: 
- Added WebSocket support (`ws:`, `wss:`) for Next.js development server
- Allowed self-framing for Next.js internal operations
- Maintained security while enabling proper functionality

### 3. Improved Middleware Matcher

**Before:**
```typescript
matcher: [
  '/admin/:path*',
  '/((?!api|_next|favicon.ico|.*\\.).*)',
]
```

**After:**
```typescript
matcher: [
  // Admin routes
  '/admin/:path*',
  // Public routes - more specific matcher to avoid RSC conflicts
  '/((?!api|_next|_vercel|favicon.ico|.*\\.|.*\\.hot-update\\.).*)',
]
```

**Rationale**: 
- Added `_vercel` exclusion for Vercel-specific requests
- Added `.hot-update.` exclusion for development hot reloading
- More specific pattern to reduce conflicts

## Testing Results

### Navigation Test Status
- âœ… Home page (`/`) - Loading successfully
- âœ… About page (`/about`) - Navigation fixed
- âœ… Portfolio page (`/portfolio`) - Navigation fixed
- âœ… Team page (`/team`) - Navigation fixed
- âœ… Admin routes (`/admin/*`) - Authentication working
- âœ… API routes (`/api/*`) - Properly excluded from middleware

### Performance Impact
- âœ… No additional latency introduced
- âœ… Middleware compilation successful
- âœ… Hot reloading working properly
- âœ… Development server stable on port 3001

## Security Considerations

### Maintained Security Features
- âœ… XSS Protection (`X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`)
- âœ… Content Type Sniffing Prevention (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`)
- âœ… Clickjacking Protection (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`)
- âœ… Referrer Policy (`strict-origin-when-cross-origin`)
- âœ… Permissions Policy (camera, microphone, geolocation restrictions)
- âœ… Admin route authentication (bypassed in development)
- âœ… Cache control for sensitive admin pages

### Updated Security Features
- ðŸ”„ CSP updated for Next.js 15 compatibility while maintaining security
- ðŸ”„ Frame restrictions relaxed for self-origin only
- ðŸ”„ WebSocket connections allowed for development server

## Deployment Notes

### Development Environment
- Server running on port 3001 (port 3000 in use)
- Stack Auth bypassed for admin routes in development
- Hot reloading and RSC working properly

### Production Considerations
- All security headers remain active in production
- Stack Auth authentication enforced for admin routes
- CSP allows necessary connections while blocking malicious content
- WebSocket support enables real-time features if needed

## Files Modified

1. **`middleware.ts`** - Core middleware logic updated
   - RSC request detection improved
   - CSP headers updated for Next.js 15
   - Matcher configuration refined

## Verification Steps

1. âœ… Development server starts without errors
2. âœ… Middleware compiles successfully
3. âœ… Navigation to all public routes works
4. âœ… No `ERR_ABORTED` errors in browser console
5. âœ… Admin authentication still functional
6. âœ… API routes remain accessible

## Next Steps

- Monitor application in production environment
- Test with various browsers and devices
- Verify performance metrics remain optimal
- Consider additional CSP refinements based on usage patterns
