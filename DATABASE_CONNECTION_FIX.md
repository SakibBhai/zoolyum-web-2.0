# Database Connection Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing PostgreSQL connection errors:
```
prisma:error Error in PostgreSQL connection: Error { kind: Closed, cause: None }
```

## Root Cause
Multiple API routes were creating individual `PrismaClient` instances instead of using a shared singleton, leading to:
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Premature connection closures
- Database connection instability

## Solution
Replaced all individual `PrismaClient` instances with the shared singleton from `lib/prisma.ts`.

### Files Modified
1. `app/api/services/route.ts`
2. `app/api/homepage/services/[id]/route.ts`
3. `app/api/site/navigation/[id]/route.ts`
4. `app/api/homepage/sections/[id]/route.ts`
5. `app/api/site/navigation/route.ts`
6. `app/api/campaigns/[id]/route.ts`
7. `app/api/blog-posts/[id]/route.ts`
8. `app/api/homepage/statistics/[id]/route.ts`
9. `app/api/homepage/about/route.ts`
10. `app/api/homepage/hero/route.ts`
11. `app/api/blog-posts/route.ts`
12. `app/api/homepage/sections/route.ts`
13. `app/api/homepage/statistics/route.ts`
14. `app/api/homepage/services/route.ts`

### Change Pattern
**Before:**
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';
```

## Benefits
- **Connection Pooling**: Single shared connection pool
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced database connections
- **Stability**: Eliminated connection closure errors
- **Performance**: Better connection reuse

## Verification
- ✅ All PostgreSQL connection errors resolved
- ✅ API routes functioning normally
- ✅ Database queries executing successfully
- ✅ No connection pool exhaustion

## Best Practices
1. Always use the shared `prisma` instance from `@/lib/prisma`
2. Never create new `PrismaClient()` instances in API routes
3. The shared client handles connection pooling automatically
4. No need to manually disconnect in API routes
